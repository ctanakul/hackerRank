# Takeaway

###1. (Pure) virtual function
- A virtual function needs declared function definition no matter it is merely "{}" or "= 0" (pure function).
- Abstract base class cannot be used to create an object but still can be pointed to be a pointer.
- A pure virtual function makes a class become an abstract class which cannot instantiate an object and can be used as a base class only.
###2. Static variable declared in base class
- The value initiation must be done outside of the variable declaration in base class.
