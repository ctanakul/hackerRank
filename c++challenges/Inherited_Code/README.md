### 1.Exception Handling
- An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
- Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.
- C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.
- try − A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions will be activated. It's followed by one or more catch blocks.
- catch − A program catches an exception with an exception handler at the place in a program where you want to handle the problem. The catch keyword indicates the catching of an exception.
- throw − A program throws an exception when a problem shows up. This is done using a throw keyword.
- Basically,'catch' anything that is thrown by and 'throw'
--- it could be throw an integer, const char* block etc.
