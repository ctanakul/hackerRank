### 1.Sets
- Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.
- each value must be unique (Think of mathematic set in general.)
- The value inside a set cannot be modified, they are all of 'const'.
- The elements can be inserted or removed out of a set.
- The elements in a set always get sorted by its internal comparison object.
- std::set is vary similar to std::map in that it has unique keys. Only it does not have associated value.
- examples would be writing a dictionary with std::set<std::string>, but if one would like to count the frequency a word appears, he can use std::map<std::string, int>
